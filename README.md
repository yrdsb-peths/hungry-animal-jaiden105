# Hungry Animal Tutorial
This is the README.md file.
The features I added to this game was a dash button. To dash, you would need to press space in the direction you want to dash and the elephant would rapidly move forward for a split second. There is a cooldown of 1 second to prevent players from infinitly dashing.
